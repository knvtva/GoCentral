# GoCentral
A Rock Band 3, Green Day, The Beatles Rock Band master server re-implementation written in Golang using MongoDB as the database layer and my Quazal Rendez-vous-compatible forks of [nex-go](https://github.com/ihatecompvir/nex-go)/[nex-protocols-go](https://github.com/ihatecompvir/nex-protocols-go) as the underlying server layer.
